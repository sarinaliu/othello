Last week, my bot that beat SimplePlayer was based on choosing the best option using a scoring board heuristic. This week, I extended this strategy to a depth of 3, which would allow the bot to make better choices based on predicting two future moves. First, the program will push all the possible best moves based on that scoring system into a vector. Next, the program will predict the opponent's best move based off of each of my possible best moves. The opponent's move should be subtracted from your first score and minimized. Finally, the program will predict the subsequent possible best moves. Your score should be concantenated and maximized. The move that gives the highest score should be traced back to the original move, which should be done onto the board. Having a depth of 3 should make my bot competitive against Better Player, an improvement from just beating SimplePlayer last week. I attempted to do recursion, which would have allowed me to seach to depth n, but saving the state of the potential board did not work out.
